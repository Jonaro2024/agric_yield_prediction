# agric_yield_prediction (case study of states in Nigeria) step by step approach used
Create a synthetic dataset with the following features: state, soil_type,  rainfall_mm,  temperature_c,  yield_tonnes_per_hectare. 
Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Abnalysis) on the data set.
Segregate the input and output.
Split the data into train and test dataset in the ratio of 80:20 respectiely.
Performed data transformation using OneHotEncoder for soil_type category and StandardScaler for numerical features.
Build machine learning model on the transformed train dataset using KNN algorithm (KNNRegressor).
Performed model prediction on test data.
Carry out feature importance analysis.
Carry out full pipeline integration.
Visualize results.
